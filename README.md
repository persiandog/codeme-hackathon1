## General info
This project is a result of my first hackathon during a Python programming course.
The first task I worked on is a simple address book.
## Tech info
The project uses:
* Python 3
* sys module
	
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../Hackathon1
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## Features
The main features of the presented address book include: adding a new contact, deleting a contact, viewing full contact list and exiting the programme.

## Status
Although the hackathon is over, the project status is _work in progress_. Due to time constraints, the solution developed is not ideal but will be improved in future.
Feel free to contribute.

## Inspiration
As mentioned above, the address book solution was inspired by a hackathon task.
